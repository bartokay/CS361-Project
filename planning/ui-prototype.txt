> Sure! Here are some tips for using VA Finder: 
-- Selecting "Search by Character" will first search for anime characters matching your name search. Many characters have similar or the same names, so you will then be able to select from a list of matches. Once the character that you're searching for is confirmed, the voice actor who voices that character will be displayed, along with the top ten most popular characters they voice for.

-- If you know the voice actor's name already, you can select the "Search by voice actor" option. This option will also display the top five matches from anilist for you to scroll through using the arrows on your keyboard.

-- Using both first and last name in either search option increases your chances of finding a match

-- This tool was built using the anilist API, so the popularity of characters is based on
   the anilist rankings.

-- Selecting "Exit" stops the program.
